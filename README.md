=========

This game is a cocos2d-x demo. When studying the cocos2d-x framework, I put all that I learned into this game to make a better memory. It is a isometric RPG game about a hero fighting with enemies. Game resources and server-end code will not be uploaded. Any advises would be pleased.

Dependency:

cocos2d-x 2.2.1

pomelo 0.8.0
